            Hi, I am Carlos Eduardo Galdona, I'm in my 3rd semester of Software Engineering Technician at Centennial College.

            With a passion for coding, I've gained experience in both front-end.  I'm proficient in various programming languages and frameworks, and I'm always eager to expand my skillset with new technologies.
